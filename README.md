## Getting Started

Refer to the [Flutter Docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Prerequisites

To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

- Operating Systems: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit), x86-64 based
- Disk Space: 1.64 GB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools).
- Tools: Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment.
- Windows PowerShell 5.0 or newer (this is pre-installed with Windows 10)
- Git for Windows 2.x, with the Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt option.

If Git for Windows is already installed, make sure you can run git commands from the command prompt or PowerShell.

### Tips For Installing

1. *Do not install Flutter in a directory like C:\Program Files\ that requires elevated privileges.*

2. Don't forget to run `C:\src>git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable`

3. Tips for the PATH variable.

  - MAKE SURE YOU ARE UNDER THE 'USER VARIABLES' NOT 'SYSTEM VARIABLES'
  - **DO NOT** REPLACE THE USER 'PATH' VARIABLE. 
  - **Instead DOUBLE CLICK on the 'PATH' variable to add more**
  - **READ THAT TWICE**
  - **IF YOU MESSED UP** Recovery is not easy, as you will have to create a path variable and add paths to gitbash.exe, powershell.exe, and some more windows default ones (trust me, I did it by accident)
  - **READ THAT A THIRD TIME**

4. If you are to scared to run path variables, you can always just copy and paste the file path to the flutter.bat file everytime you want to run a flutter command

## Tips For Setting Up The Emulator

The emulator may go up easily (most likely not), here's a few tips that may help.

1. Make sure you have VM enabled in BIOS
2. Check under project structure to make sure your "Project Structure" is an Android SDK
3. Make sure you have platform tools enabled
4. Google's your friend, stack overflow too
